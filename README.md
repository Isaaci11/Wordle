# Wordle

Java Emulation of Wordle. 

Emulated New York Times Wordle in java where a player attempts to correctly guess a random five-letter word; This game differs from the original as it’s a two-person game in which one user inputs a five-letter word which is guessed by the other; The program prompts the user for a word which is checked against an ArrayList of every valid word in the english langue and with each guess, the 2D array game board will be printed as well as the guessed letter bar below it.
